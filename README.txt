How to use shortcodes for WB Slider:

Here's a brief explanation on how to use shortcodes for WB Slider:

1- Basic Usage:To display a slider on any page, post, or widget, use the shortcode:[wb_slider]. This will display the slider with default settings.
2- Custom ID: You can specify particular slides to include by using the 'id' attribute:[wb_slider id="1,2,3"]. This will display slides with IDs 1, 2, and 3.
3- Custom Ordering: By default, slides are ordered by date. You can change this using the 'orderby' attribute:[wb_slider orderby="title"]. This would order the slides by their titles.
4- Slider Options:The plugin also allows for global settings that affect all sliders:
* Slider Title: Set in the admin panel, applies to all sliders.
* Display Bullets: Option to show or hide navigation bullets.
* Slider Style: Choose between different styles (style-1 or style-2).
These options are set in the WordPress admin area under "WB Slider Options" and don't require additional shortcode attributes.
5- Shortcode Location: You can use this shortcode in any WordPress editor, including page/post content areas and text widgets.

Remember to adjust your settings in the WB Slider Options page in the WordPress admin area for global slider configurations. The shortcode provides a flexible way to display your sliders with custom parameters when needed.
